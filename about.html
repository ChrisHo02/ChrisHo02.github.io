								<h2>Who I am<br /></h2>
								<p>I am a motivated and analytical problem-solver with a passion for technology. My strengths lie in my ability to think critically and apply existing knowledge to solve complex problems. I am confident in my ability to work independently, however, I also thrive in team environments, where I tend to play a more analytical role, with a focus on the small details of a project.</p>

For further education, I chose to study Computer Science at the Unviersity of Bath.
